# Seam Carver
This project was an assignment in a basic software course in college.

The goal was to apply the seam carving algorithm for content-aware image resizing.

## Usage
Java command line arguments:

```
SeamCarver [filepath] [horizontal lines to remove] [vertical lines to remove]
```

- filepath must point at a file that's a [PGM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html) image plain format (P2) file.
